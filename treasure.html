<li><center><strong><h3>Network packet</h3></strong></center>
<p>You are given a series of incoming network packets, and your task is to simulate their processing.
Packets arrive in some order. For each packet number i, you know the time when it arrived Ai and the
time it takes the processor to process it Pi (both in milliseconds). There is only one processor, and it
processes the incoming packets in the order of their arrival. If the processor started to process some
packet, it doesn't interrupt or stop until it nishes the processing of this packet, and the processing of
packet i takes exactly Pi milliseconds.
The computer processing the packets has a network buer of xed size S. When packets ar-
rive, they are stored in the buer before being processed. However, if the buer is full when a packet
arrives (there are S packets which have arrived before this packet, and the computer hasn't nished
processing any of them), it is dropped and won't be processed at all. If several packets arrive at the
same time, they are rst all stored in the buer (some of them may be dropped because of that 
those which are described later in the input). The computer processes the packets in the order of
their arrival, and it starts processing the next available packet from the buer as soon as it nishes
processing the previous one. If at some point the computer is not busy, and there are no packets in
the buer, the computer just waits for the next packet to arrive. Note that a packet leaves the buer
and frees the space in the buer as soon as the computer nishes processing it.</li>

<li><center><strong><h3>Bike race</h3></strong></center></p>
Suppose in a long bike race you decided to participate.suppose the length of the track is n and there is some place to refill the fuel.
as you know during the time of refillment of fuel ohter competitors can beat you as they can left you back.In worst case  suppose all 
running their bike at their max speed.and you want to win the race.
before the day of race you have been given the complete manual of the race such as the length of the track ,number of place to refill the fuel
and at what distance they are loacted from starting point.after reading all the mauals you caame to realise that the only way to win the race
is  to minimise the number of refillment. 
so just maximiz your chance of wining the game by finiding the most effective way to reach the finish point by using minimum number of refillment.</p>
